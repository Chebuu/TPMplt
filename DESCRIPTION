Description: This package provides a simple approach for dynamic materials
  modeling (DMM) suggested by Prasad and Gegel <doi:10.1007/BF02664902>. It
  can easily generate various processing-maps based on this DMM as well. The 
  calculation in TPMplt contians full materials coefficeints, infromations
  about power dissipation efficiency factor, and rheological stability, can
  be exported completely also, through which further analysis and customized
  plots are applicable as well.
